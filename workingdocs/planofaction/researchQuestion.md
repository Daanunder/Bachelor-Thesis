# Research Question & Hypothesis
## Research questions

1. What is the order of errors produced by D-Flow FM as a result of numerical diffusion and dispersion for different parameters of the discretization scheme?

2. How sensitive is the accuracy of the D-Flow FM model to time, space and numerically related parameters when applied to a lock-exchange experiment?

3. What parameters in the D-Flow FM model have the largest influence on errors related to numerical diffusion and dispersion?


## Hypotheses
1. The order of errors is of 10E-4

2. It is very sensitive to time and space related parameters and can be slightly improved by numerical parameters.

3. The time step size, grid resolution and viscosity have the larges influence leverage on the accuracy of the model.
