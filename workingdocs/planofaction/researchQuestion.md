# Research Question & Hypothesis
## Research questions

1. How much numerical diffusion and or dispersion does the D-Flow FM model produce when simulating a 3D lock-exchange experiment dependent?

    1. What is the order of errors produced by D-Flow FM as a result of numerical diffusion and/or dispersion?

    2. How sensitive is the accuracy of the D-Flow FM model to time, space and numerically related parameters?

    3. What sort of errors are produced given different parameters?

    4. What parameters in the D-Flow FM model have the largest influence on errors related to numerical diffusion and dispersion?

    5. Are there indicators that predict the occurrence of numerical diffusion and dispersion in D-Flow FM?
    

## Hypotheses
1. There is significant numerical diffusion and negligible numerical dispersion in the D-Flow FM model when performing a lock-exchange experiment. 

    1. The order of errors is of 10E-4

    2. It is very sensitive to time and space related parameters and can be slightly improved by flow model parameters.

    3. Mostly numerical diffusion errors are produced except when more elaborate advection schemes are applied. 

    4. The time step size, grid resolution and viscosity have the larges influence leverage on the accuracy of the model.

    5. Examples of such indicators are the dimensionless Reynolds and Froude numbers or the ratio between the net diffusivity coefficient in the model and the eddy
