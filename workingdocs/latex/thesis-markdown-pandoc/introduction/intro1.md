This is how you insert figures using markdown. Also how to insert citations copied over from your bibliography manager (I specifically used Pandoc Citations in Papers).

![Interphase and the different stages of mitosis. Figure from Walczak et al., 2010[@Walczak:2010uk]. \label{mitosis} ](figures/mitosis_Walczak.pdf)
 
See Figure \ref{mitosis} for a schematic illustration.

You need to insert empty lines at the end of each section.....
